1 What is RAMSES
--------------
RAMSES is an abbreviation for "Rendering Architecture for Multi-Screen
EnvironmentS". It implements a distributed system for rendering 3D content
with focus on bandwidth and resource efficiency.
Within the distributed architecture RAMSES defines 2 main roles for
applications.
- Clients provide graphical content using a scene graph interface.
- Renderers receive graphical content and render it while dealing with all the
  platform specific constraints.

2 Building and testing
-----------------------------------
RAMSES can be cloned from its Genivi repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/GENIVI/ramses <ramses-sdk>
cd <ramses-sdk>
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Building RAMSES on Windows:
- start CMake GUI
- select <ramses-sdk> as source path, choose arbitrary <build> folder.
Configure
If you want to build the tests, set 'ramses-sdk_BUILD_TESTS' to true in the CMake cache.
generate -> open solution in Visual Studio.

Building RAMSES on Linux with docker:
We prefer to build RAMSES in Docker because it abstracts the dependency installation
and the CMake invocations away from the user. Docker is installed slightly differently
on different distros, check the docker manual for your distro. The instructions below
are for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS:

```
apt install docker.io
groupadd docker             #can fail if already exists
usermod â€“aG docker $USER

#re-login or restart for the group changes to take effect

docker run hello-world      #check that docker works

# build RAMSES docker container
cd <ramses-sdk>/scripts/docker
./build-basic-container.sh
# Start RAMSES docker
./start-basic-for-x11.sh    # (on wayland-enabled systems, optionally: ./start-basic-for-wayland.sh)
# Inside docker container
./build-ramses.sh
# optionally - check if all RAMSES features work on your system
./run-unittests.sh
```

Building RAMSES on Linux:
- install dependencies using Distro of choice package manager. For example, for
Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libgles2-mesa-dev
mkdir <build>
cd <build>
cmake <ramses-sdk>
```

You can also check the docker container setup scripts for a reference how to build:
```
<ramses-sdk>/scripts/docker/ramses-basic/Dockerfile         -> contains info about build dependencies
<ramses-sdk>/scripts/docker/runtime-files/build-ramses.sh   -> contains CMake command for building
```
